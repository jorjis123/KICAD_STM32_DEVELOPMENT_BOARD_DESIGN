Core MCU: STM32 with access to essential debug/programming interfaces (SWD/SWO/NRST, UART, I2C).

🔹 Power: USB input and dedicated 12V jack, with on-board buck converter for stable 3.3V supply.

🔹 Connectivity: Breakout headers for easy prototyping.

🔹 Layout focus: Optimized ground plane distribution, decoupling capacitors placed for noise reduction, and routing for signal integrity.

🔹 Applications: Ideal for embedded firmware development, educational use, and rapid prototyping.

This project gave me great hands-on experience in schematic capture, PCB layout, power distribution, and embedded hardware design best practices.
